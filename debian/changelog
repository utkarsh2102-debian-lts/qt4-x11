qt4-x11 (4:4.6.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Revert previous s390 specific change as it did not solve FTBFS.
  * Do not link webkit with -Wl,--gc-sections on s390. This should workaround
    FTBFS on s390 caused by internal linker error which is due to bugs when
    processing UString.o and some others (built with -ffunction-sections).
    Implemented in the 96_webkit_no_gc_sections.diff patch.
  * Steal patch from upstream 4.6 branch to fix s390 atomic ops related
    crashes. One of them made the package to FTBFS. Upstream commit:
    cdf4701f442149546043b155cddcc53116875f1c
  * Update symbol files for amd64, i386, ia64, kfreebsd-amd64, kfreebsd-i386,

  * Do not build webkit with debugging symbols on s390. These becomes too big
    and thus the build fails, as the linker can't handle more than a couple of
    GB large files, and debugging symbols on s390 are real large. This is a

  * New upstream release.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Split OpenGL headers from libqt4-dev to libqt4-opengl-dev:
    - Update install files.
    - Make libqt4-opengl-dev depend on X OpenGL headers, hence remove the
      latter from libqt4-dev Recommends.
    - Add libqt4-opengl-dev to libqt4-dev Recommends.
    - Remove libq4-opengl from libqt4-dev Depends.
  * Explicitly add libqtcore4 to libqt4-dev (was implicit before).
  * Rename libqt4-gui to libqtgui4 (new package).
  * Make libqt4-gui a transitional package (Closes: #478694) depending on
    libqtgui4, libqt4-opengl (Closes: #478264), libqt4-sql, libqt4-designer,
    libqt4-assistant.
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${source:Version} in dependencies of
    libqt4-core and libqt4-gui transitional packages.
  * Require just libqtcore4 to install libqt4-dbg instead of libqt4-gui.
  * Resync patches:
    - 05_append_qt4_target.diff - fix offsets.
    - 11_qdbus_to_dbus_fix.diff - remove, merged upstream.
    - Revert to "runtime" configuration for xcursor, xinerama, xfixes and drop

  * Update installed files: new qt help and assistant translations.
  * Add qt-copy patch:
    * 0226-qtreeview-column_resize_when_needed

  +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Add libqt4-sql-sqlite dependency to qt4-dev-tools. Qt Assistant and
    qhelpgenerator use the sqlite plugin. (Closes: #476986)
  * Remove qt-copy patches 0191 and 0192. The relevant code has changed
    such that neither patch seems to have any effect (although listviews
    still do not use active/inactive roles correctly).
  * Add qt-copy patches:
    * 0223-fix-qpixmap-hasalpha
      Fix a performance regression in QPixmap::hasAlpha() in Qt 4.4.
    * 0224-fast-qpixmap-fill
      This patch avoids the expensive image->pixmap conversion by discarding
      the old pixmap, creating a new one with the correct format, and doing
      the fill server side.
    * 0225-invalidate-tabbar-geometry-on-refresh
      Fix problem where Konsole's tab bar is not shown immediately on startup.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Downgrade libqt4-dev *gl*-dev dependencies to Recommends.
    They pull in half of X11 development headers and are rarely needed.
    What's more, OpenGL apps will probably depend on them explicitly anyway.
  * Add development packages of the SQL plugins to libqt4-dev Suggests.
  * Make libqt4-sql recommend its plugins. Depends does not do us any good
    because we don't know which plugin a user is going to use anyway. Moreover
    installation of the libqt4-sql package does not necessarily imply usage of
    the specific plugin(s). Finally, this resolves circular dependencies among
    libqt4-sql and its plugins.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Add 16_always_init_qt_x11data_ptrx.diff, which ensures that X11->ptrX*
    are properly initialized when Xcursor, Xinerama, Xfixes are not available
    in default "runtime" configuration  (Closes: #476608).
  * Pass -xfixes -xcursor -xinerama to configure because default "runtime"
    configuration requires a user to have libxfixes-dev, libxcursor-dev and
    libxinerama-dev installed to enable features requires respective X
    libraries (QLibrary simply searches for "lib*.so"). This change in
    configuration makes 16 patch irrelevant for Debian, but I'm leaving it
    as it's still the fix for the crashes which might occur on default Qt 4.4
    configutions.
  * Optimize qmake: pass -optimized-qmake to configure.

    not be generated - as it ends up being crackful. After a bit of patching
    they are a bit less crackful though. (Closes: 457570)
  * Postprocess prl files to remove the same crack as in the pc files.
    (Closes: 470572)
  * Do a bit nicer linking when needed instead of relying on crackfulness from
    prl and pc files.
  * Add a disabled patch to generate better prl files, but unfortunately too
    much of qt4 build process relies on on it and is not yet fixed, but it is
    saved for later use.
  * Fix qmake makefile generation - should not add double slashes to
    makefiles.
  * Make libqt4-core transitional package arch:any. It doesn't bloat the
    archive too much, but it helps on installability.

  * Remove 51_kfreebsd_mkspecs patch. Moved in rules.
  * Add 0187-fix-font-fixed-pitch patch:
    This patch works around broken QFontInfo::fixedPitch by always using a

  * Apply qt-copy patches:
    * 00_0185-fix-format-strings: This patch fixes various code issues with
      handling format strings. None of them seem to be exceptionally bad,
      but its better safe than sorry. It is related to CVE-2007-3388.
      TT claims the problem is not present in any version of Qt 4. Dirk Muller
      disagrees and believes that some of them are possible to exploit.
    * 00_0186-fix-component-alpha-text: This patch fixes component alpha
      (LCD hinted) text when it's drawn on a non-opaque background. Qt doesn't
      initialize the alpha channel in the glyph masks, which causes problems
      in Konsole when transparency is enabled, and in other situations where
      the background isn't fully opaque.

  * Added build-deps on libdbus-1-dev and libglib2.0-dev, and added
    libQtDBus to the libqt4-core package

qt4-x11 (4.1.4-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Reintroduce the libpq-dev dependency, which seems to have been removed by
    mistake in 4.1.0-2. (Closes: #327618)

qt4-x11 (4.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #378443)

  * Moved usr/lib/libQtDesigner.so.* and
    usr/lib/libQtDesignerComponents.so.* from qt4-designer to libqt4-gui
    so there the libqt4-dev package won't contain dangling symlinks
    (Closes: #374612)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Jul 2006 15:39:29 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/19_s390_atomic: patch from Bastian Blank to fix
    including of s390 specific atomic header. (Closes: #370241)

  * debian/patches/18_disable_opengl_visibility.dpatch: regenerated so
    that it applies correctly for me

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Jun 2006 11:42:57 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * patches/18_disable_opengl_visibility: disable -fvisibility-inlines-hidden
    for src/opengl/opengl.pro as it makes gcc ICE on alpha.
    (Closes: #368883)

  * urgency set to high so that qt4-x11 stops blocking half of unstable out of
    testing.

 -- Pierre Habouzit <madcoder@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jun 2006 10:28:29 +0200

qt4-x11 (4.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release

  * debian/patches/16_hppa_ldcw_fix.dpatch: new patch from Ubuntu to
    properly support hppa

  * debian/patches/17_alpha_ice.dpatch: new patch from Steve Langasek to
    fix FTBFS on alpha (Closes: #368883)
    (urgency set to high for that fix).

  * Dropped the .la files since they pull in too many unneeded
    dependencies (Closes: #360802)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: removed
    usr/lib/qt4/plugins/codecs/*_debug.so since those aren't included
    upstream anymore

  * Increased standards version to 3.7.2

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jun 2006 17:56:32 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libqt4-debug-dev.install, debian/libqt4-dev.install: added
    wildcards to install .a static libraries so that the libQtUiTools and
    libQtAssistantClient libraries are included (Closes: #358224, #355902)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 14 May 2006 10:03:40 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * debian/control: removed dependencies on xlibs-static-dev and
    xlibs-static-pic to transition to building against modular X
    (Closes: #362262)

  * debian/control: changed x-dev dependencies to x11proto-core-dev, for
    modular X transition (Closes: #362053)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Apr 2006 10:35:28 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixes the broken debug-and-release build and a load of resulting
      bugs (Closes: #337764, #337847, #341807, #338380, #354993, #347251)
    - debian/patches/15_alpha_ftbfs_fix.dpatch: removed, integrated upstream

  * debian/control: updated libqt4-debug-dev priority to match that of the
    override file

  * debian/libqt4-dev.links: added a symlink /usr/share/qt4/bin/rcc to
    /usr/bin/rcc (Closes: #349438)

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added libqmng.so and libqgif.so plugins
    (Closes: #354266)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Mar 2006 10:20:47 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved *_debug.prl and *_debug.la support files to the libqt4-debug-dev
    package

  * Updated to debhelper v5 compatibility

  * debian/qt4-dev-tools.install: removed the /usr/share/qt4/templates
    entry, which no longer contains anything

  * Added gif support (Closes: #348092)

  * debian/patches/12_mips_atomic_ops.dpatch: applied fixes from Isaac
    Clerencia <isaac@debian.org>, as the last patch was not good enough to
    fix the FTBFS bug (Closes: #335831)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Jan 2006 09:49:11 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/12_mips_atomic_ops.dpatch: Updated patch to account for
    2 new functions, q_atomic_test_and_set_acquire_int and
    q_atomic_test_and_set_release_int, that were added in this release.
    This should again fix the build failures on mips. (Closes: #335831)

  * debian/patches/13_arm_ftbfs_fixes.dpatch: renamed, added a fix for the
    new build failure due to a poorly defined qreal (Closes: #347360)

  * debian/control: build against libmysqlclient15, and updated all
    dependencies to libmysqlclient15-dev (Closes: #346586)

  * debian/control: added explicit dependencies for libqt4-dev on the
    Source-Version packages libqt4-core, libqt4-gui, libqt4-sql, and
    libqt4-qt3support.  These dependencies were accidentally dropped in
    the last version.  Also removed some unneeded dependencies.

  * Split the *_debug.so symlinks out of libqt4-dev and into a separate
    libqt4-debug-dev package.  Made the libqt4-debug-dev package depend on
    the Source-Version of libqt4-debug.  This way, the symlinks won't be
    dangling if libqt4-debug isn't installed and prevents failed linking
    due to version mismatches.  (Closes: #346603, #346605)

  * Re-enabled sqlite3 support.  It's still statically linked, however,
    but that'll have to do because I really don't want to futz with the
    build system. (Closes: #330976)

  * Enabled sqlite2 support

  * debian/patches/15_alpha_ftbfs_fix.dpatch: new patch to rename
    q_atomic_test_and_set_release_ptr to q_atomic_test_and_set_ptr, as
    suggested by Isaac Clerencia <isaac@debian.org>, to fix a FTBFS on
    alpha. (Closes: #347353)

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_for_debian: renamed from
    10_qmake_use_qt4_tools, and updated to remove the "link_prl" from the
    default qmake CONFIG line.  This disables the recursive linkage
    against all indirectly-used libraries. (Closes: #343190)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jan 2006 19:29:52 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixes missing QBitArray operators (Closes: #341658)
    - Fixes qmake problem with including bad build path (Closes: #327359)

  * Added the new QTestLib unit testing framework to the libqt4-core
    package

  * Added the new QtSvg module to the libqt4-gui package

  * debian/patches/13_arm_gcc4.dpatch: new patch from Jeremy Laine to fix
    FTBFS on arm (Closes: #343176)

  * debian/patches/14_kfreebsd_build_fix.dpatch: new patch from Petr
    Salinger to fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD (Closes: #343191)

  * Split the qtconfig tool out of libqt4-gui and into a separate
    qt4-qtconfig package, due to its linkage against libqt4-qt3support and
    hence ridiculous dependency chain.

  * debian/rules: improved/cleaned up the clean target

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed,  4 Jan 2006 12:56:23 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a target to automatically install lintian overrides, stolen from
    debian-qt-kde.mk

  * Added a bunch of lintian overrides for stuff that should be ignored

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Nov 2005 01:17:03 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: made libqt4-gui replace libqt4-core (<< 4.0.1-3), for
    the plugins move (Closes: #336492)

  * debian/control: removed the mention of a qt4-examples package that
    doesn't actually exist from the qt4-doc package description

  * debian/rules: remove all *.so files under
    examples/tools/plugandpaint/plugins/ in the clean target
    (Closes: #339674)

  * Removed the menu entry for designer-qt4 from qt4-dev-tools.menu, and
    added it to a new qt4-designer.menu

  * Added a tarball of the examples to qt4-doc (Closes: #336832)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Nov 2005 10:27:03 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed qt4-designer's section to "devel"

  * Added a patch from Thiemo Seufer to fix the FTBFS on mips/mipsel
    (Closes: #335831)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Oct 2005 00:13:40 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: only install the non-debug codecs, since
    the debug ones pull in a gratuitous dependency on libqt4-debug
    (Closes: #328913)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: install the debug codecs here instead

  * debian/control: replaced obsolete xlibs-dev dependency with the
    required split packages (Closes: #329302)

  * Completely disabled SQLite support since it's too fubar in this
    version to be usable.  The build fails with SQLite2 support, and
    SQLite3 is only supported by linking staticly with a version
    distributed in the Qt source.  Meh.

  * Renamed libqt4-designer to qt4-designer, merged in the designer binary
    from qt4-dev-tools, and added a dependency on libqt4-dev
    (Closes: #330094)

  * Moved the plugins installed in libqt4-core to libqt4-gui, since they
    link against the GUI library.  Otherwise a circular libqt4-core <->
    libqt4-gui dependency results.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Oct 2005 00:28:53 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_use_qt4_tools.dpatch: new patch that modifies
    qmake.conf so that qmake generates Makefiles that use the -qt4 tools.
    This way, it can cope with systems that have alternatives set to use
    the -qt3 versions.

  * Increased the conflicting Qt3 package versions to <= 3.3.4-7, since
    the Qt3 packages still don't use the alternatives system as needed to
    coexist with Qt4.

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added /usr/lib/qt4/plugins/codecs

  * debian/patches/11_launch_assistant-qt4: new patch that modifies the
    QAssistantClient class to launch Qt Assistant as "assistant-qt4" to
    cope with the alternatives system (Closes: #327294)

  * debian/control: Upgraded libqt4-dev's dependencies on the modules
    libqt4-sql and libqt4-qt3support from suggests to depends, and added
    libpq-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev | libmysqlclient-dev as
    dependencies.  These dependencies are apparently required to make
    building pkg-config-using packages happy. (Closes: #327618)

  * debian/control: corrected libqt4-sql to suggest libmysqlclient14-dev,
    not libmysqlclient12-dev which is deprecated

  * debian/copyright: updated FSF snailmail address

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: removed the libqt3supportwidgets_debug.so
    designer plugin, since for some reason having this installed breaks
    designer (Closes: #325782)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Sep 2005 12:32:53 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Install changes-4.0.1 as upstream changelog

  * debian/manpages/assistant-qt4.1: new manpage written from scratch
    based on the output of "assistant -help"

  * debian/manpages/designer-qt4.1, debian/manpages/linguist-qt4.1:
    manpages stolen from the Qt3 packages and trivially adapted for Qt4
    (Closes: #322403)

  * debian/manpages/moc-qt4.1: escape some '-' characters

  * debian/qt4-dev-tools.manpages: install the new assistant-qt4.1,
    designer-qt4.1, and linguist-qt4.1 manpages

  * debian/control: made qt4-dev-tools recommend qt4-doc, since assisant
    needs it to be useful (Closes: #323251)

  * Removed the FAQ from qt4-doc.docs, since it's no longer included in
    4.0.1, and was useless anyway

  * Build-depend on libmysqlclient14-dev since libmysqlclient12-dev is
    scheduled to be removed

  * debian/libqt4-dev.install: work around TT's broken "install" target in
    this release so that the pkgconfig files are installed in
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig instead of directly in /usr/lib.  Grrrr.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Aug 2005 19:28:35 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed the xlibs-pic dependency to xlibs-static-pic
    for the X.org transition (Closes: #319586)

  * Added manpages for lrelease, lupdate, moc, qtconfig, and uic, stolen
    from the Qt3 upstream tarball, and wrote a manpage for qmake from
    scratch.  Since now manpages are included for all executables using
    the alternatives, the symlinks to them no longer dangle.
    (Closes: #319456)

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added
    usr/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats/libqjpeg.so to include the jpeg
    plugin (Closes: #321582)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: added the libqjpeg_debug.so plugin

  * debian/rules: don't hardcode the /usr/include/postgresql/8.0 path,
    instead of the output of `pg_config --includedir`, stolen from Qt3
    packages

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added the OpenGL module library so that it
    actually gets included in a package (Closes: #321874)

  * debian/control: updated the package descriptions to note that the
    Network and XML modules are included in the libqt4-core package, and
    the OpenGL module is included in the libqt4-gui package

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Aug 2005 08:58:10 -0700

    + (Build-)depend on libxinerama-dev (Closes: #318682)
